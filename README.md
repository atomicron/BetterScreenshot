# BetterScreenshot

This is a software for making screenshots;

Details:
Simple software I made for myself to use to take screenshots of my screen or a part of the screen.
You can use it like the snipping tool, but there's some stuff it gives in addition, like automatically
saving taken snipes images, automatically setting the taken image to your clipboard (which I find useful),
and other stuff. 

Security warnings:
Using a low level hook (because I want to play around with the print screen key signal) will most likely
cause windows defender or anti virus to pop with issues.

Supported platforms:
Windows
